# Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting diseases based on patient symptoms using machine learning algorithms. The objective is to assist early diagnosis by analyzing medical input features and identifying the most probable disease.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Workflow
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature encoding and scaling
- Model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN, etc.)
- Model evaluation and comparison

## Outcome
The trained models demonstrate effective disease classification and highlight the importance of data-driven approaches in healthcare analytics.

## Future Scope
- Deploy as a web application
- Integrate real-time user inputs
- Improve accuracy using ensemble models
